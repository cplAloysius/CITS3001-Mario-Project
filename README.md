# CITS3001-Mario-Project
This project aims to compare the performance between 2 agents in playing Super Mario Bros

- [Rule Based Object Detection Agent](#rule-based-agent)
- [Proximal Policy Optimisation(PPO) Agent](#ppo-agent)

## Rule Based Agent
- Run `python mario_objects.py` to see the rule based agent play mario

## PPO Agent
- Run `python train.py` to train the model (you can train a new model or load a previously trained model)

- Run `python test.py` to test your trained model

- Models will be saved to the 'train' folder locally (too large for github)
